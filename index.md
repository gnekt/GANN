## Welcome to the main page of GANN

This project is built for the exam of Machine Learning at University of Siena  

### Goal

The goal of this repo is firstly to realize the assignment proposed by our professor Marco Gori, secondly after some coding i realize that instead of using normal Run-Degub Script, i realize a simple library to abstract a Neural Network (it's an accademic way) to optimize the time that i spent in front of a monitor (now is quite a lot work/university).

So i use the same NN abstraction to complete the tasks that our professors give us.
